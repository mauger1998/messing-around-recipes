# odin-recipes
        This will be my first project with Odin and I will be creating a basic
    recipe page in html.
        Skills I will demonstrate in this project are...
    * An understanding of how to set up the html boiler plate with the doctype, language, charset, head and body.
    * Using elements such as <p> <h1> <a> and <img> along with attributes such as href, src and alt.
    * Inputting images into a webpage.
    * Including links in a webpage.
