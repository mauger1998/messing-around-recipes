        <h2>About this dish</h2>
        <p>This isn't your typical "knock your socks off hot" chicken curry, this is different. I'm not a massive fan of spicey myself so this curry contains sweeter elements such as coconut and mango chutney.</p>
        <p>This is a quick dish perfect for yourself or for the entire family!</p>
